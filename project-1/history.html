    <h3 class="about">The Prehistory of Wine</h3>
    <p class="about">
      Wine making didn't just start in one location and suddenly spread. There’s
      archaeological evidence of wine making stretching back to 7,000 BC in
      China and later examples in Greece, Sicily and Georgia to name just a few.
      By 4,000 BC people were producing wine on a larger scale in regions like
      Armenia where the oldest known winery was recently discovered. The Areni-1
      cave in Southern Armenia suggests that wine making for the locals had been
      around for a lot longer. According to site archaeologist Gregory Areshian:
      “This is the earliest, most reliable evidence of wine production. For the
      first time, we have a complete archaeological picture of wine production
      dating back 6,100 years.”

    <h3 class="about">Wine and Later Civilisation</h3>
    <p class="about">
      Wine played an important part in many civilisations including the Egyptian
      where it was part of ceremonial life. The Phoenicians were also great wine
      makers and probably one of the first big producers to transport and
      distribute their own vintages around the Mediterranean. Of course, you
      can't forget the Greeks and then the Romans, both of whom helped develop
      much of the culture that surrounds wine which we see today. Indeed, the
      Romans were responsible for making significant advances in wine making
      technology including mixing it with herbs and minerals to make medicinal
      drinks.
    </p>
    <h3 class="about">Wine and Europe</h3>
    <p class="about">
      We often associate wine making with areas of Europe like France while not
      realising how universal it has always been. Wine was a staple part of
      European society by the Middle Ages, mostly for the rich who could afford
      it rather than the lower classes. The development of the vineyards that we
      recognise today in areas like Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne can be
      attributed to the Benedictine monks. Much of the wine producing world we
      know today grew out of areas like this, spreading to countries as far
      reaching as Australia, New Zealand and the Americas as new communities
      were formed. Thomas Jefferson, when he was made minister to France, was
      largely responsible for the United States becoming a wine producing nation
      when he visited Bordeaux in 1785. It wasn't until the California Gold
      Rush, however, that it really took off, fed by a real mix of people from
      all over the world who wanted wine. With ever more sophisticated processes
      being developed, it comes as no surprise that certain vineyards began to
      gain notoriety for their own vintages. That led to standards being set
      such as the appellation d'origine controlee which protects the geographic
      production of certain products, including wine, in France. With greater
      provenance, wine collecting also became popular and it's not unusual
      nowadays for certain bottles to sell for thousands of pounds. A recent
      sample of a bottle of Château d'Yquem from 1860 to 2003 sold for $1.5
      million. The good news is that the wine industry across the world seems to
      be in pretty good health. Even in regions like the UK we're seeing
      vineyards develop and produce good quality, homegrown wines. That’s
      brilliant news for wine lovers who are always looking for something a
      little different to excite their palates.
